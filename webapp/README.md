# Raiden Paywall Demo Webapp

This is a small blog webapp showcasing how a paywalled resource can be retrieved from the server. 
It provides a Vue plugin that abstracts the paywall related responses from the application that consumes the paywalled resource.
The plugin shows a pop up and redirects the user to the [Raiden dApp](https://github.com/raiden-network/light-client/tree/master/raiden-dapp) for making a payment.
